                <p><h1>Growth and Yield Performance of Different Variety of Cornn Grow Under Western Samar Condition</h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
    <h4> NATURE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY </h4>
    <p>Corn plant belong to the grass family or graninae, botanically called Zea Mays. It is a summer crop grown not only for human consumption but animal feed as well. It ranks third to wheat and rice as the world most commonly grown food crop, corns to most countries in Asia, particularly in the Philippines.
    About 20.8 percent of the total population eat corn grots especially in areas where it is abundant.</p>
    <p>When rice harvest is poor, it is used as a substitute, because aside from being cheap, it has higher calories content as rice. Yellow corn is a rich source of vitamin A. its protein, fats, and minerals are comparatively high. However, most of our people refer white flint corn because of its color and higher percentage of recovery from miling. (Fever 1971)</p>
    <p>Livestock and poultry raising is one of the nation big industries, so there is also an increasing demand of the said crop for feeds and other corn by-products such as flour and starch converted into cosmetics, explosives and the like.</p>
    <p>Nowdays, quite a number of corn varieties developed by researcher institution have found to be resistant to insect pest diseases, responsive to specific cultural practices and adapted to specific environmental condition. These varieties, however, need to be tested under a wide range of environmental codition. (Wallace, 1945)</p>

    <h3> OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p> The study was conducted with the follwing objectives.</p>
    <p> 1.To evaluate the growth and yield performance of the different varieties of corn grown under western condition.</p>
    <p> 2.To determine which corn variety perform well under Western Samar Condition.</p>
    <p> 3.To determine the most economecal corn variety grown under Western Samar condition.</p>
    <h4> Time and Place of the Study</h4>
    <p> This study was conducted in Brgy. Danao I Tinambacan District, Calbayog City from December 14 to February 25, 2005.</p>
    <h4> Scope and Limitation of the Study</h4>
    <p> This study was focused on the growth and yield performance of different variety of corn grown under Western condition.This was conducted at Brgy. Danao 1 Tinambacan Dist. Cabayog City.</p>

                <h2>EXERCISES REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>This exercise was a great lesson in structured web design. I moved past using generic div tags and successfully implemented semantic HTML to build a clear. Using header, nav, main, and footer created a solid, professional framework. Most importantly, carefully segmenting the core content with aside, section, and article ensured that the purpose of every part of the page was clear not just visually, but also structurally to browsers. I now understand that this web design is the most critical step in building an accessible and maintainable website.</p>
