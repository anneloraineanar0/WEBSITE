            Ooh, I fall apart 
            Ooh, yeah 
            Hmm-hmm, yeah 
            She told me that I'm not enough (yeah) 
            And she left me with a broken heart (yeah) 
            She fooled me twice, and it's all my fault (yeah) 
            She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (yeah) 
            Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (yeah) 
            And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah 
 
            Ooh, I fall apart, down to my core 
            Ooh, I fall apart, down to my core 
            Ooh, didn't it know before 
            Surprised when you caught me off guard 
            All this damn jewelry I bought 
            You was my shorty, I thought 
            
            Never caught a feelin' this hard 
            Harder than the liquor I pour 
            Tell me you don't want me no more 
            But I can't let go, everybody told me so 
 
            Feelin' like I sold my soul 
            Devil in the form of a whore 
            Devil in the form of a whore 
            You said that-, no, you said that- 
            No, you said we'd be together, oh 
 
            Ooh, I fall apart, down to my core 
            Ooh, I fall apart, down to my core 
            Ooh, didn't it know before 
            Surprised when you caught me off guard 
            All this damn jewelry I bought 
            You was my shorty, I thought 
 
            Ice keep pourin', and the drink keep flowin' 
            Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin' 
            Covered in scars and I can't help showin' 
            Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin' 
            Ice keep droppin', and the drink keep flowin' 
            Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin' 
            All these scars, can't help from showin' 
            Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin', yeah 
 
            Ooh, I fall apart, down to my core 
            Ooh, I fall apart, down to my core 
            Ooh, didn't know it before 
            Surprised when you caught me off guard 
            All this damn jewelry I bought 
            You was my shorty, I thought 
            
            Ay, ay 
            Is you 
            Ay, ay 
            Ay, ay 
            Is you 
            Ay, ay

    <h3>Description List</h3> 
    <b><dt>Novocaine</dt></b> 
    <dd>This is a brand name for a local anesthetic, which is a drug used to numb a specific area and block pain. In the song, Post Malone sings, "And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine." He's not literally using the drug; he is using alcohol ("takin' these shots") as a way to numb the emotional pain of his heartbreak, likening the effect of the liquor to the numbing power of Novocaine.</dd>
